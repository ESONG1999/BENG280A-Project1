This is the code for BENG280A-Project1
We use U-Net for image segmentation of Covid-19 CT images.
This repository is based on this [repository](https://github.com/milesial/Pytorch-UNet)
We implemented our code on both [Lung_Segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/finding-lungs-in-ct-data) dataset and [Covid-19_Segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/covid19-ct-scans) dataset.
